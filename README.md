# PowerDistributor -mini-

## General remarks
This small board is designed to simplify and organize the wiring in your glider.
A pair of terminals is provided for each device to be connected, one each for the device and the associated fuse.
Up to 8 individual devices can be connected.

The board and terminals are designed for a much higher electrical load than should ever be needed in a glider, at least 10 Amps per channel and in total.

## Electrical installation
Integrating the board into the cabling is extremely simple.
For each device to be connected, there is a terminal for the device itself and the associated fuse.
This keeps the wiring harness simple and flexible; changes to devices or fuses do not require any adjustments to the circuits of other devices.
The wiring is shown in the following diagram.

## Wago Terminals

All terminals are easy to operate, just push the actuator with a little screwdriver and push-in or pull-out the conductor.

The terminals for fuses and devices are suitable for various types of wires:
- Solid concductor 0.2 - 1.5 mm^2
- Fine-stranded conductor 0.2 - 1.5 mm^2
- Fine-stranded conductor with ferrule 0.25 - 1.0 mm^2

The terminal for the main supply can handle conductors up to:
- Solid concductor 0.1 - 4.0 mm^2
- Fine-stranded conductor 0.1 - 4.0 mm^2
- Fine-stranded conductor with ferrule 0.25 - 2.5 mm^2

## Mechanical installation

The half housing is 3D-printed and reliably protects against short circuits on the contacts on the underside of the board.
With four mounting holes for M3 screws, the board can be securely and firmly mounted in the aircraft, with the screws fixing both the housing and the board at the same time.

## Disclaimer
Installation and use of the board are the sole responsibility of the user.
The board has been built to the best of our knowledge and belief, but no warranty or guarantee can be given for correct functioning or interference immunity.
The legal usability must be checked before each individual installation and, in case of doubt, clarified with competent and authorized personnel (CFS).
